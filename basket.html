              <h2>The History of Basketball</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
              <p>The first set of rules was published and distributed through the YMCA movement in 1892 and this resulted in the game spreading rapidly throughout Canada and the USA. 1892 also saw the game played in England for the first time at Birkenhead YMCA after the Club President was the game played whilst on a business trip to Canada. In 1893 the game was introduced into the Physical Training College in Hampstead (now Dartford College of PE) by Madame Berman Osterberg. Changes to the game to suit the girls led to the first rules of netball being published in 1901.
By 1898 a professional league was established in the USA and by 1911 basketball had spread throughout the UK as a sport. In 1924 it was introduced as a demonstration sport at the Paris Olympic Games and Great Britain won the title. 1927 saw Abe Saperstein a Londoner from the world famous Harlem Globetrotters and in 1931 FIBA the International Basketball Federation was formed with a Welshman as its first secretary.
The England Basketball Association was formed in 1936, 13 years before the NBA was formed in America, and by 1957 the English Schools Basketball Association was formed. The 1970’s saw the introduction of both men’s and women’s national leagues in the UK, and by 1999, 219 teams were entered in the over 16 national leagues with almost 100 competing at under 15 levels. By 1990 there were 117 member countries in FIBA making basketball the second largest of all the world’s governing bodies and also the world’s fastest growing and largest participation sport.
To date there are 212 member countries worldwide, whilst in the UK alone there are over 500,000 people who regularly participate in recreational basketball and it has become increasingly common to find the sport as part of the curriculum in schools at all levels. It is also used widely as a community activity as anyone of any age or gender can participate. Basketball is now included in the Commonwealth Games and the sport in general received a lot of coverage when the GB wheelchair team performed very successfully in the Paralympics recently, proving that it is a sport that is accessible and playable by all</p>

                <p>The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters. <br> Click on the image to find out more</p>
