    discipline. Time management plays a ig role within an athlete, especially the professional athletes that play in a
    high level. For example, athletes need to attend training sessions as part of their daily routine. To attend these
    training sessions, they should manage their time to arrive at a certain place on a specific time.</p>

    <p>As we all know, sports is all about teamwork, in most sports. Sports encourage young and grown athletes to
    expose their talent and communicate within one another. Teamwork requires a lot of communication and chemistry
    between the players and teammates. Also, one team could have a captain, and it could potentially be you. Therefore,
    you also need leadership skills to lead the team and motivate teammates to build on the chemistry. Sports is also
    a game where equality and justice comes into place. Losing and winning is part of the game, however we know that
    losing is not the fun part. But losing and accepting defeat shows how much a sportsperson is and makes the athlete
    strive harder for the next competitive matches to achieve what they have lost in the past.</p>
