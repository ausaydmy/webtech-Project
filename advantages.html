    so people assume that it is difficult to manage an athlete's time with their school or college work.
    However, it is actually not difficult since sports require memorization, repitition, and learning skills.
    These skills are similar to the skills required for academic work. Also, sports teach teamwork and problem
    solving skills which include the whole team's effort and participation. Sports have an objective to achieve,
    therefore, trying to achieve it as a whole team builds teamwork and communication between the team to face
    and solve problems.</p>
